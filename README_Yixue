----------
To Deploy
----------
1) Change the baseurl to "/~yixuezha/" in the config folder
2) Generate the content. In the root directory run:
    hugo
3) Delete the old website. 
    a) ssh to aludra.usc.edu: 
        ssh yixuezha@aludra.usc.edu
    b) run the command:
        yes | rm -rf public_html/*
4) Check generated `public/misc/index.html` to see if js/css paths 	  are correct. See below for details.
5) On local machine, copy the public directory to aldura:
    scp -r public/* yixuezha@aludra.usc.edu:~/public_html


## Photo Gallery Issues

1. Make sure the following code is added to the file `themes/academic/layouts/partials/widget_page.html` right before the last `{{ end }}`. Screenshot is attached below.
```
 <!-- Load PhotoSwipe js if the load-photoswipe shortcode has been used -->
{{ if ($.Scratch.Get "photoswipeloaded") }}
<script src="/js/load-photoswipe.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/photoswipe.min.js" integrity="sha256-UplRCs9v4KXVJvVY+p+RSo5Q4ilAUXh7kpjyIP5odyc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/photoswipe/4.1.1/photoswipe-ui-default.min.js" integrity="sha256-PWHOlUzc96pMc8ThwRIXPn8yH4NOLu42RQ0b9SpnpFk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
{{ end }}
```
<img src="static/img/widget_page_screenshot.png" > 


2. Make sure in `content/misc/_index.md` the `dir="/img/gallery/"` has `/` before img.

3. the urls of static/css and static/js are not generated correctly by hugo command. Go to the generated file `public/misc/index.html` and find paths `/js/load-photoswipe.js` and `/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css`. Then manually add `/~yixue/` in the beginning, e.g.,  `/~yixue/js/load-photoswipe.js`. 

4. change mentoring page following 3 as well (since it uses photo gallery)

1. Followed this instruction: https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1677

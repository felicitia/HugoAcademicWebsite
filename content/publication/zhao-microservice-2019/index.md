abstract: "A large number of techniques for analyzing and
optimizing mobile apps have emerged in the past decade. However, those techniques’ components are notoriously difficult to
extract and reuse outside their original tools. This paper introduces MAOMAO, a microservice-based reference architecture
for reusing and integrating such components. MAOMAO’s twin
goals are (1) adoption of available app optimization techniques
in practice and (2) improved construction and evaluation of new
techniques. The paper uses several existing app optimization techniques to illustrate both the motivation behind MAOMAO and
its potential to fundamentally alter the landscape in this area"

 abstract = {A large number of techniques for analyzing and optimizing mobile apps have emerged in the past decade. However, those techniques' components are notoriously difficult to extract and reuse outside their original tools. This paper introduces MAOMAO, a microservice-based reference architecture for reusing and integrating such components. MAOMAO's twin goals are (1) adoption of available app optimization techniques in practice and (2) improved construction and evaluation of new techniques. The paper uses several existing app optimization techniques to illustrate both the motivation behind MAOMAO and its potential to fundamentally alter the landscape in this area.},

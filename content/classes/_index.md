The world is endless, and I've always been fascinated by new (sometimes seemingly random) knowledge. New knowledge not only gives me joy when learning it, but also comes handy someday and gives me creative ideas! Here's a list of the "random" classes I've taken throughout the years. I'm super grateful for the era I'm living in! ðŸ¥°

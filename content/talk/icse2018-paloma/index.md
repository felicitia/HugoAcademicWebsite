summary:
abstract: "Reducing network latency in mobile applications is an effective
way of improving the mobile user experience and has tangible
economic benefits. This paper presents PALOMA, a novel clientcentric technique for reducing the network latency by prefetching
HTTP requests in Android apps. Our work leverages string analysis and callback control-flow analysis to automatically instrument
apps using PALOMA’s rigorous formulation of scenarios that address “what” and “when” to prefetch. PALOMA has been shown
to incur significant runtime savings (several hundred milliseconds
per prefetchable HTTP request), both when applied on a reusable
evaluation benchmark we have developed and on real applications."

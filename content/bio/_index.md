### Bio #1 (when wearing meditation hat üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

Dr. Yixue Zhao holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Southern California (USC). Her outstanding academic contributions have led to prestigious publications, U.S. Patents, and notable awards, such as Computing Innovation Fellow recognized by National Science Foundation and Computing Research Association, Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant, and Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE) Merit Award.

These conditions in a high-stress Ph.D. environment also taught her that ‚Äúfame can‚Äôt buy happiness‚Äù. Inspired by a major mental breakdown, Dr. Zhao was determined to find a way out of her mental suffering. As a scientist at heart, she experimented with all kinds of methods of well-being, including many mindfulness practices, numerous well-being courses and books, and different types of therapy.

In 2020, to celebrate her Ph.D. graduation, Dr. Zhao joined a TWIM (Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation) online retreat led by David Johnson from Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center. The unconditional happiness and peace were beyond her wildest dreams and had long-lasting effects after her retreat. This turning point has changed her trajectory to dedicate her remaining life to the well-being of herself and others. She has been trained under Bhante Vimalaramsi, Bhante Kusala, and Acariya Delson Armstrong. 

Dr. Zhao was a Research Scientist at USC‚Äôs Information Sciences Institute and AI4Health Center, conducting interdisciplinary research on well-being using modern technology. In 2025, she was laid off due to the lack of funding and became a free spirit to continue her same passion on well-being research without any "labels". Among all her titles, Dr. Zhao is most proud of ‚Äúthe most positive person I‚Äôve ever met‚Äù and strives to maintain it. Dr. Yixue Zhao‚Äôs website: [yixuezhao.com](https://yixuezhao.com/).

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Southern California (USC). I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nenad Medvidović](http://sunset.usc.edu/~neno/) throughout my Ph.D., which raised my interest in pursuing an academic career.
I enjoy solving important and interesting problems with broad research interests, focusing on the area of <b>Software Engineering</b>.
Prior to USC, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China in 2014, advised by Professor [Zhongjie Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/rainy).

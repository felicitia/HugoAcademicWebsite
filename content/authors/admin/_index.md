Hi there! ü§ó I'm a Computer Scientist by training, a Generalist at heart with broad research interests (knowledge has no boundaries, right?). My current research focus is listed below (it changes overtime, largely driven by how the world changes and who I meet). What doesn't change is that I always work on what I enjoy with people I love. What a blessing! ü•∞ I'm my own boss now guided by what makes my heart sing. ‚ú® Before my independence, I was a Research Computer Scientist at [USC Information Scienced Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/) and [AI4Health Center](https://www.isi.edu/centers-ai4health/), a [CIFellow](https://cifellows2020.org/2020-class/) at University of Massachusetts Amherst ([UMass](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)) awarded by NSF and CRA, and [Microsoft Research (MSR) Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/2019-dissertation-grant-recipients-embarking-on-diverse-paths-to-scientific-and-societal-impact/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/)). Before my PhD, I grew up in China and received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)).

Throughout my research projects, I enjoy working with people the most. I love learning about leadership and mentoring very much! My mentoring experience can be found [**here**](mentoring/).

My work is my biggest hobby these days and I'm always learning something new (it feels like getting new toys!). Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, watching anime with my husband, taking fun classes (see [**class list**](classes/)), [**writing blogs**](https://medium.com/@yixue-zhao), reading books, Jazz & K-Pop dancing, and [**meditation**](https://open.substack.com/pub/yixuezhao/p/how-i-sit-for-8-hours-in-meditation?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) (my fav hobby! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

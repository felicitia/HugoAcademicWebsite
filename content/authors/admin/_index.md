<!-- **I'm on the job market for research positions in industry (CV [here](files/CV_Zhao_Yixue.pdf))! If you love your team and you have openings, let's talk! :) My email: felicity.yixue [AT] gmail.com** -->

I'm a Research Computer Scientist at [USC Information Scienced Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/) Arlington (VA), doing cool research and working with cool people üòä I enjoy solving important and interesting problems with broad research interests (knowledge has no boundaries, right?). My current research focus is listed below (it changes overtime, largely driven by how the world changes and who I meet). Prior to ISI, I enjoyed 2 wonderful years in the beautiful town Amherst (MA) as a Computing Innovation Fellow ([CIFellow](https://cifellows2020.org/2020-class/)) at University of Massachusetts Amherst ([UMass](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/)) in 2020. Before my PhD, I grew up in China and received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)) in China.

Throughout my research projects, I enjoy working with people the most. I love learning about leadership and mentoring very much! My mentoring experience can be found [**here**](mentoring/).

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, taking fun classes (see [**class list**](classes/) ), [**writing blogs**](https://medium.com/@yixue-zhao), and [**meditation**](https://yixue-zhao.medium.com/how-i-sit-for-8-hours-in-meditation-3906645aa80c?source=friends_link&sk=a017e657ea8b61ce102fb8f66504fdcc) (my fav hobby! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
